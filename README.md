# EDA_of_Indian_athletes_in_marathon

# Project Overview:
- Analyzed a comprehensive dataset of marathon athletes from various countries, with a focus on Indian athletes.
- Utilized data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights.

# Key Responsibilities:
- Utilized pandas to clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, and correcting data types.
- Added new columns to enrich the analysis.
- Applied numpy for numerical operations and calculations.
- Analyzed performance trends, demographic information, and seasonal participation rates.
- Created compelling visualizations using matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, plotly.express to present the findings.
- Developed various plots including histograms, bar graphs, pie chart and line charts to illustrate key insights.
- Identified performance trends across different age groups and seasons.

# Key Insights:
- Age and Performance: Younger athletes tend to have faster marathon times, while experienced athletes show consistency over the years.
- Seasonal Trends: Higher participation rates and better performance were observed during specific seasons, indicating favorable weather conditions.

# Conclusion:
- This project not only enhanced my data cleaning and analysis skills but also deepened my understanding of how demographic and seasonal factors can impact athletic performance. 
- It was a valuable experience in using data to tell a compelling story and provide actionable insights.
